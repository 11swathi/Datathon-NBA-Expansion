# NBA-Expansion

This is a project we did in the Datathon24 Competition where, 53 teams representing 370 smart undergraduate and graduate students across the University of Maryland - Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, and American University - Kogod School of Business participated. 

- I'm thrilled to announce that our team advanced to the finals where top 6 teams out of the 53 teams are shortlisted, and we secured the Sixth position in the Finals.
- We had the honor of presenting our findings in front of the esteemed Deloitte panelists.
- It was a great experience and I learned a lot about presentations and a proejct workflow.

## Question
With the growing popularity of professional basketball, the National Basketball
Association (NBA) is looking to expand their league from 30 teams to 32. There have
been talks of these teams being placed in Seattle, WA and Las Vegas, NV. However, the
NBA isn't sold on these being the best options and wants to explore other cities to
maximize the profit, viewership, and international marketability for the NBA. Your team
of consultants and data scientists have been hired to recommend how the NBA should
proceed with this expansion.


## Case Background – NBA Information
* Background on the NBA as a league
  -The National Basketball Association (NBA) was originally the Basketball Association of America (BAA) which
was created in 1946. The league at the time only had 11 teams.
  - The original NBA’s “Western” Division was only really the Midwest – they hadn’t expanded to places like
California or Oregon.
  - Since its inception, the NBA has expanded to a total of 30 teams playing in major cities all throughout the U.S.
and Canada.
* Background on NBA as a business
  - The 2022/23 season raked in $10.58 billion (~5% increase in revenue from 2021/22 season).
  - The average valuation of NBA teams in 2023 was $3.85 Billion.
  - The NBA is the third most watched sport in the U.S. trailing closely behind the MLB.
* Opportunities for the NBA
  - Streaming is the new cable, and more teams could equal more viewership on apps viewers already have.
  - More teams could mean more sponsorships, greater viewership, higher competition, increased broadcasting
rights, and more merchandise sales.


## Case Questions
1. Your team has been provided with a dataset including thousands of US cities. Use this data and/or any other data you find to
select 2 cities to pitch to the NBA as prime locations for the association’s expanse.
  - What are the two cities that your team sees as the best options to place a new team in? How did your team come to
this conclusion?
2. Choose one of the two locations you selected above. The NBA would like to understand estimated revenue and costs
associated with this new location.
  - How much capital will the NBA need to spend to cover the costs associated with the new location?
  - Estimate the annual revenue generated for the new team's major revenue streams. How long will it take to break even?
  - Perform an analysis on the best sponsor for this new NBA team considering factors such as brand alignment, social
media engagement, and potential financial impact.
3. The NBA would like to preemptively create a promotional plan for the new team you selected above.
  - Based on your analysis and/or research of the new city and fanbase, propose a team mascot and team colors. Why that
mascot? Why those colors?
  - How might the NBA promote this team to the new city to maximize brand awareness and fanbase growth?
  - Despite the NBA not being an inherently global brand, one executive wants to explore the possibility of growing a
fanbase for the new team in an international market. Select a country you recommend they target and explain why this
market could be a successful endeavor for the NBA.
  - What technology would you use to support the marketing, logistical, and/or management efforts for the new team?
